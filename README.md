# javascript-interesting-features
A list of interesting features I found in javascript. A lot of them are probably deprecated, but we wilding here (just like javascript).

-------

- Labeled statements
- Generators
- Object.defineProperty
  - Setters && Getters
- ArrayBuffer
- Proxy
  - Handling method calls that don't exist, like with PHP's __call magic method
